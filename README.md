# Discrete_Element_Modelling-of-CD_Triaxial_Test
Compiled a code for discrete element modelling of Consolidated Drained Triaxial test of granular soil using LIGGGHTS. 
Contains the input script for the triaxial test for a specimen of heigth 140 mm and 60 mm wide with fixed boundary conditions. Also has the stl files (walls) used in the code
Radial expansion method is implemented for tight packing with low or almost no coeeficient of friction and restitution.
A Particle size distribution ranging from 0.75 mm to 1.35 sphrecial in shape equally distributed by volume is used.
Consolidation is attained servo controlled frictless thin walls (stl file) on all the sides. The walls are designed in Auto-CAD
Shearing is then carried out using Strain-controlled wall which can be varied based on the user's requirement. A user-defined coefficient of friction is applied before shearing.
